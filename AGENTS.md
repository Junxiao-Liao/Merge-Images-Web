# AGENTS.md — MergeImages v2

This repository currently only contains design documents:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `REQUIREMENTS.md`

Implementation has not started yet, so build/lint/test commands and code
conventions will be filled in once real code and tooling exist.

## Current guidance
- Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the intended architecture (SvelteKit UI + Rust/WASM engine, no PWA).
- Read `REQUIREMENTS.md` for functional and testing requirements.
- Do not add Service Workers or a Web App Manifest.

## Placeholder for future updates
As the codebase is implemented, expand this file with:
- Exact build/lint/test commands (including single-test commands).
- Code style guidelines (imports, formatting, types, naming, error handling).
- Any Cursor/Copilot rule summaries (if added later).

Keep this file updated as the project grows.
